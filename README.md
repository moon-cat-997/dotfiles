# 🛠 dotfiles

A personal repository of configuration files and helper scripts for automatically setting up a development environment on **Linux** and **macOS**.

> 📁 This repository is intended to be cloned directly into your **home directory** as `~/dotfiles`.

---

## 📦 Features

- One-command environment setup via `install.sh`
- Multiple Git identities picked **automatically by directory** via [`git-hat`](utilities/git-hat/README.md)
- Zsh and SSH client configuration
- Helper scripts (`hat`, `update-system`)
- Platform-specific setup (Linux; macOS is a stub)

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# First clone on a fresh machine must be HTTPS — no SSH keys exist yet
git clone https://github.com/kotikobormotik812/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This will:

- Create symbolic links for configuration files in your home directory
- Make all scripts executable and link them into `~/bin`
- Run `hat sync` to generate per-persona git/ssh configs (and create the persona directories)
- Run platform-specific setup depending on your OS (on Linux: installs packages
  incl. `gh` and `keyd`, symlinks `common/keyd/*.conf` into `/etc/keyd`, and
  enables the `keyd` service)

On a **new machine**, finish the bootstrap with:

```bash
gh auth login    # HTTPS credentials are delegated to gh
hat keygen       # generate missing per-persona SSH keys, upload pubkeys via gh
hat doctor       # verify: gh, keys, dirs, live ssh auth per persona
```

See [utilities/git-hat/README.md](utilities/git-hat/README.md) for the full bootstrap details.

## ⚙️ Usage

### Run the setup script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

### Update your system (Linux):
```bash
update-system
```

### Check which Git identity is in use:
```bash
hat whoami      # persona assigned to the current directory
```

### Clone repositories with the right identity:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/Own
hat clone git@github.com:org/repo.git   # clones via the persona's SSH alias
```

> All helper scripts are symlinked into `~/bin` and available globally.

---

## 🔧 Git Identity Management

Identity is selected **by directory**: each persona in
`utilities/git-hat/personas/<name>.conf` declares a `DIR`, and `hat sync`
generates the `includeIf "gitdir:..."` blocks and `github-<name>` SSH aliases
from it. Everything outside a persona directory defaults to personal.

- `~/Projects/Own/**` → personal
- `~/Projects/JuliusAgency/**` → office
- `~/Projects/Own-old/**` → work (deprecated account)

Details: [utilities/git-hat/README.md](utilities/git-hat/README.md).

## 🐧 Supported Platforms

- ✅ Linux (tested on Manjaro)
- ⚠️ macOS (basic support, work in progress)

---

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure `~/bin` is in your `$PATH`
- All `.sh` files in `linux/` are made executable during installation
- Aliases and environment variables are set in `zshrc` under `common/`
- `common/keyd/*.conf` are symlinked into `/etc/keyd`, so editing them in the
  repo changes the live config — apply with `sudo keyd reload`
- Private SSH keys are never committed; regenerate them with `hat keygen`

---

## 🧩 Planned Improvements

- Ask about username instead of hardcoding `/home/dmitriy`
- Auto-install of Zsh plugins and fonts
- Homebrew integration on macOS
- Automatic backup of existing config files before linking
- Dotfiles version detection and self-update logic
